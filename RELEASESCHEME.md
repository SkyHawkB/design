# Koi Release Scheme
The planned release scheme for Koi, not including hot fixes or implementation-dependant releases.

When the implementation of Koi contains all parts of a version, it is now considered a release of that version. Implementations of the main Koi compilers and interpreters will be based on this release scheme.

The version scheme is based on semantic versioning; major, minor, patch.
